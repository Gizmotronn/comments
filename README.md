# Comment tool for NFTS
Allows users to comment on specific NFTs in a collection (via the collection's website) using their ethereum address. 

Certain permissions can be setup by modifying the smart contract (for example, you can set the commenting feature to only be enabled if the user is a holder in the collection)
